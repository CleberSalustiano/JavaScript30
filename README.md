# JavaScript30

This repository was created to publish the 30 exercises of the "JavaScript30" course, the purpose of the course is to practice JavaScript fundamentals by doing 30 exercises, one exercise per day (but maybe I do more than one per day). And the most important part is JUST VANILLA Javascript, and sometimes i use css too.

## For use this

If you want to compile this, just download and open the "index.html" in the folder about some exercise.
